  # Ministry_of_testing
</div>

A comprehensive collection of manual and functional test cases designed for practice across sites such as **DemoQA**, **TestSheepNZ**, and other live testing environments.

This repository is part of your continuous learning initiative to strengthen real‑world testing skills by documenting detailed test scenarios, steps, expected results, and validation techniques for multiple web applications.

## How to Use

1. Browse through the folders to explore test cases for each site.
2. Open the CSV/Markdown test case documentation.
3. Import them into your preferred testing tool (Katalon Studio, TestLink, Zephyr, etc.).
4. Follow the steps manually or use them as a base for automation.
