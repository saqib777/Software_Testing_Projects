## Notes & Observations  
1. **Positive Findings**  
   - Dropdowns populate quickly and correctly.  
   - The new account creation flow is intuitive and accessible.  
   - UI elements are well-labelled and form layout is clean.

2. **Issues Observed**  
   - If the existing account dropdown has accounts with zero balance, behavior is unchanged (should warn or gray out).  
   - Placeholder text missing in some fields (e.g., “from account”).  
   - Confirmation feedback sometimes lacks unique account ID visibility immediately after creation.

3. **Performance & Security Notes**  
   - Page load consistently under 3 seconds in normal conditions.  
   - Under load, delays past 4 seconds observed.  
   - Logging out immediately after creation sometimes retains session data (possible session handling concern).
